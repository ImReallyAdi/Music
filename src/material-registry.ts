// Import Material Web Components
import '@material/web/all.js';

// If specific sub-components are needed that aren't in all.js (rare for this library), import them here.
// But mostly all.js covers the basics.
// Note: We might need to import specific icon sets if we were using Material Symbols,
// but we are likely using Lucide React for icons, wrapped in md-icon if needed, or just Lucide directly.
// Material Web components often expect Material Symbols font. We should probably stick to Lucide for consistency
// unless we want to load the Material Symbols font. The prompt says "Use expressive typography...".
// Using Lucide inside md-icon is possible.
